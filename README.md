# Pub OAPI Tools Commons

A series of utilities used across several pub-oapi-tools programs.
These are mainly for connecting to various 3rd-party systems,
(e.g.) the UCPMS reporting DB, eSchol DB, various APIs, etc.

3rd-party packages required for each module are imported within the modules,
Using 'import pub_oapi_tools_common' will import all 3rd-party packages
along with the pub_oapi_tools_common modules.

reStructuredText docstrings are used throughout.
